# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on Bike rentals](https://github.com/rushi2012/Linear-Regression)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills Used:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Linear Regression, Matplotlib Pyplot, Seaborn

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable Results:** We could predict the bike rental demand resulting in **94% accuracy**. 

- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Diagnosis of breast cancer using a logistic classifier](https://github.com/rushi2012/Logistic_Regression)

<img src="images/breast-cancer.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills Used:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Logistic Regression, Matplotlib Pyplot, Seaborn

**Project Objective:**  Classifying Biomechanical Features of Orthopedic Patients based on provided Features to decrease the time required for finding a diagonasis.

**Quantifiable Results:** We could classfy the type of tumor resulting in **94% accuracy**. 

- Used logistic regression to identify a tumour as malignant or benign based on various attributes
- Classified tumors as benign or malignant by studying patterns in measured attributes of those tumors
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis

[Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal](https://github.com/rushi2012/KNN_NB_Project)

<img src="images/knee-brace-ortho.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib, KNN, NB

**Project Objective:** In this project we are provided with multiple instances of orthopedic parameters and we are also provided with their classification as Normal or Abnormal. We have to implement K Nearest Neighbour, the algorithm is used to classify points according to class of their K nearest neighbour points. 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the orthopedic parameters as Normal or Abnormal with an **accuracy of 85% with K=1**.

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance

[Prediction of user interest using bank data](https://github.com/rushi2012/Logistic_Regression/blob/main/bank_project.ipynb)

<img src="images/Bank_Portu.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** In this project you will be provided with real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.
The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in **91% accuracy** using Logistic Regression and SMOTE .

- in this project we are given real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.
- The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

[TalkingData Project on Bagging and Boosting ensemble model:](https://github.com/rushi2012/Ensamble_Algo.git)

<img src="images/credit_card.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib, AdaBoostClassifier, BaggingClassifier

**Project Objective:** In this problem, we will use the features associated with clicks, such as IP address, operating system, device type, time of click etc. to predict the probability of a click being fraud.

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the Pepole who downloaded the app after watching the advertisement  with an  **90.5% accuracy** .

- Used the Adaboost Classifier algorithm to classify the People who downloaded the app after watching the advertisement and identify the click fraud
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a BaggingClassifier model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance
